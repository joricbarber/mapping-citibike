                Citi Bike launches in late May with 330 stations. The stations are located in Manhattan south of 59th Street and in 
                Brooklyn north of Atlantic Avenue and west of Nostrand Avenue. Within its first month, there is a reported 500,000 rides.

                In October, the New York City Bike Share, the operator of Citi Bike, comes under new ownership and it is announced a plan 
                to improve and expand the Citi Bike program. A 6,000 bike expansion is announced, that will double the size of network from 
                6,000 to 12,000 bikes.

                <div class="header">2015</div>
                Citi Bike expansion begins, bringing 140 new stations to Bed-Stuy, Greenpoint, Long Island City, Williamsburg, and Upper East
                Side and Upper West Side. Citi Bike riders hit a new milestone, 10 million trips in one year.

            <section class="step year-2016">
                <div class="header">2016</div>
                Citi Bike expansion continues bringing another 140 stations in the Upper East Side & Upper West Side in Manhattan and Jersey 
                City, and moving into new Brooklyn neighborhoods. The program also grows from 8,000 to 10,000 bikes. Citi Bike gains its 
                100,000th Annual Member.

            <section class="step year-2017">
                <div class="header">2017</div>
                Citi Bike adds another 142 stations in Harlem, East Harlem, Astoria, Crown Heights, and Prospect Heights, growing from 10,000 to 
                12,000 bikes.

                <div class="header">2018</div>
                NYC reaches an agreement with Lyft to dramatically expand Citi Bike - Lyft will invest $100 million 
                to improve and strengthen the system, doubling Citi Bike’s service area and tripling the number 
                of bikes in the next five years to 40,000, making it one of the largest bike share systems in the world. 
                Additionally, the Reduced Fare Bike Share program, presented by Healthfirst, which provides discounted 
                memberships of $5 per month for all NYCHA residents and SNAP recipients is expanded and enshrined in Lyft’s 
                agreement with the City.

            <section class="step year-2019">
                <div class="header">2019</div>
                Citi Bike has boomed in popularity since it debuted in 2013, nearly doubling the number of bikes in its fleet 
                and tripling the average number of daily rides. It is also now available on the Lyft app. However, due to security concerns with brakes and batteries, 
                Citibike removes 2500 ebikes from its bikeshare fleets in New York, San Francisco and Washington DC.

            <section class="step year-2020">
                <div class="header">2020</div>
                Citi Bike reintroduces e-bikes to their bike share fleet in New York City. With the COVID-19 pandemic, new 
                ridership patterns arise. On standard weekday commutes, there are typically 45% more evening commuters than 
                morning commuters. During COVID, this trend becomes even more pronounced, with more than twice as many evening 
                trips.

            <section class="step year-2021">
                <div class="header">2021</div>
                Citibike expands to Inwood and Washington Heights, completing its Manhattan expansion. It also launches in 
                Hoboken, creating a seamless bikeshare system between Hoboken, Jersey City, and New York City. Additionally, riding 
                patterns are now more complicated and unpredictable than ever, with hybrid work schedules layered on top of schools 
                reopening, and warm weather recreational rides that don’t follow traditional commuting patterns.

            <section class="step year-2022">
                <div class="header">2022</div>
                Citibike rolls out new and improved powerful e-bikes with increased safety features in May. There are now 23,500 bikes, 
                including 4,500 ebikes, across more than 1,500 stations. Citi Bike has expanded its service area to include new parts of
                Astoria, Sunset Park, and Inwood, and the West Bronx. Emboldened, Citi Bike eliminates the $3 price cap on e-bike rides 
                for members riding between outer boroughs (Queens and Brooklyn) of NYC.

            <section class="step year-2023">
                <div class="header">2023</div>
                There are currently more than 30,000 bikes and over 2,000 stations. Citibike announces that ebikes will make up roughly 
                half of their fleet by the end of 2024. The blue bikes have become popular fixtures in New York City’s landscape, making 
                appearances in films and TV shows like Succession, Blue Bloods and Entergalactic. Despite the demand, Citi Bike’s agreement 
                with New York City doesn’t include system expansion or public funding for bike share.

                <div class="header">2024</div>
                Citibike announces increases in prices to help fund station upgrades and more e-bikes. Later this year, the program will 
                open its first electrified stations to streamline the charging process for their e-bikes and cut down on 80 percent of the 
                manual battery swaps the company currently has to do.
