                to improve and strengthen the system</strong>, doubling Citi Bike’s service area and tripling the number of bikes in the next five years to 40,000, making it one of the largest bike share systems in the world. Additionally, <strong>the Reduced Fare Bike Share program</strong>,
                    providing discounted memberships of $5 per month for all NYCHA residents and SNAP recipients, <strong>is expanded and enshrined in Lyft’s 
                agreement with the City</strong>. </p>

                and tripling the average number of daily rides</strong>. It is also now available on the Lyft app. <strong>However, due to security concerns with brakes and batteries</strong>, Citibike <strong>removes 2,500 ebikes</strong> from its bikeshare
                    fleets in New York, San Francisco and Washington DC. </p>

                Hoboken, creating a seamless bikeshare system between Hoboken, Jersey City, and New York City</strong>. Additionally, riding patterns are now more complicated and unpredictable than ever, with hybrid work schedules layered on top of schools
                    reopening, and warm weather recreational rides that don’t follow traditional commuting patterns. </p>

                    <strong>appearances in films and TV shows</strong> like Succession, Blue Bloods and Entergalactic. Despite the demand, Citi Bike’s agreement with New York City doesn’t include system expansion or public funding for bike share.
