                <div class="header">2018</div>
                <p class="faded"> NYC reaches an <strong>agreement with Lyft to dramatically expand Citi Bike</strong>—Lyft will invest <strong>$100 million 
                to improve and strengthen the system</strong>, doubling Citi Bike’s service area and tripling the number of bikes in the next five years to 40,000, making it one of the largest bike share systems in the world. Additionally, <strong>the Reduced Fare Bike Share program</strong>,
                    providing discounted memberships of $5 per month for all NYCHA residents and SNAP recipients, <strong>is expanded and enshrined in Lyft’s 
                agreement with the City</strong>. </p>

            <section class="step year-2019">
                <div class="header">2019</div>
                <p class="faded"> Citi Bike has <strong>boomed in popularity</strong> since it debuted in 2013, nearly <strong>doubling the number of bikes in its fleet 
                and tripling the average number of daily rides</strong>. It is also now available on the Lyft app. <strong>However, due to security concerns with brakes and batteries</strong>, Citibike <strong>removes 2,500 ebikes</strong> from its bikeshare
                    fleets in New York, San Francisco and Washington DC. </p>
            </section>
            <section class="step year-2020">

                <p class="faded"> Citi Bike <strong>reintroduces e-bikes to their bike share fleet in New York City</strong>. With the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic, new 
                ridership patterns arise</strong>. On standard weekday commutes, there are typically 45% more evening commuters than morning commuters. During COVID, this trend becomes even more pronounced, with more than twice as many evening trips.
                </p>

                Hoboken, creating a seamless bikeshare system between Hoboken, Jersey City, and New York City</strong>. Additionally, riding patterns are now more complicated and unpredictable than ever, with hybrid work schedules layered on top of schools
                    reopening, and warm weather recreational rides that don’t follow traditional commuting patterns. </p>
            </section>
            <section class="step year-2022">
                <div class="header">2022</div>
                <p class="faded"> Citibike rolls out <strong>new and improved powerful e-bikes with increased safety features</strong> in May. There are now 23,500 bikes, including 4,500 ebikes, across more than 1,500 stations. Citi Bike has expanded its service area to
                    include new parts of Astoria, Sunset Park, and Inwood, and the West Bronx. <strong>Emboldened, Citi Bike eliminates the $3 price cap on e-bike rides 
                for members riding between outer boroughs (Queens and Brooklyn) of NYC</strong>. </p>

                <p class="faded"> There are more than 30,000 bikes and over 2,000 stations. Citibike <strong>announces that ebikes will make up roughly 
                half of their fleet by the end of 2024</strong>. The blue bikes have become popular fixtures in New York City’s landscape, making
                    <strong>appearances in films and TV shows</strong> like Succession, Blue Bloods and Entergalactic. Despite the demand, Citi Bike’s agreement with New York City doesn’t include system expansion or public funding for bike share.

                <div class="header">2024</div>
                <p class="faded"> Citibike announces increases in prices to help fund station upgrades and more e-bikes. Later this year, the program <strong>will 
                open its first electrified stations</strong> to streamline the charging process for their e-bikes and cut down on 80 percent of the manual battery swaps the company currently has to do. </p>
